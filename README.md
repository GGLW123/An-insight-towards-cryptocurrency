# An-insight-towards-cryptocurrency
This repositories will explain what is crypto-currency and the most famous one is bitcoin. What is it

## Cryptocurrency:Bitcoin
## Glossary:
   # Address(public key)
      The address for bitcoin is as follows: 1P2zCZ2kGLWSfGfirResjXVojygJWvAQ47, the address for bitcoin is always start with one.
     One can have many addresses as possible.
   # Bitcoin
      The is the currency name, network and also software itself.
   # Block
      Consists of transactions and a fingerprint of the block before this. Once the block is hashed, a proof of work is done and the            unverified transactions will now be validated. Valid blocks are added to the main blockchain by network general agreement.
   # Blockchain 
      It consists of validated blocks stacked on top of each other up to the first mined block known as genesis block.Think of it like putting boxes on top of another box, pilling up and raising in heights to a certain height which is known as 
   # Confirmations
      A "confirmation" will be created once a transaction is included in a block. In the same blockchain, once a block is mined, the transaction will have another confirmation resulting in 2. 
   # Difficulty
     It is the required computer computation in the network-wide setting which is required to find a proof-of-work.The difficulty will increase as soon as time goes by. It uses a cryptographic hash function SHA256(Secure Hash Algorithm 256 bit) to solve the computations.
   # Difficulty target
    A difficulty at which all the computation in the network will find blocks approximately every x minutes. x changes as real time changes.
   # Difficulty re-targetting
    Once every 2106 blocks, a network-wide re-calculation of the difficulty and the hashing power of the previous 2106 blocks.
   # Fees
    An excess amount included in each transaction as a network fee or additional reward to the miner who finds the proof-of-work for the new block.
   # Hash
    A digital fingerprint of some binary input.
   # Genesis block
    This is the first block to be inside the blockchain, which is used to initialize the crypto-currency.
   # Miner
    It is a network node that finds valid proof-of-work for new blocks, by repeated hashing.
   # Network
    A peer-to-peer network that transmits transactions and blocks to every bitcoin node on the network.
   # Proof-of-work
    A data which requires serious computation to find. The miners will use SHA256 algorithm to solve the problem and find a solution.      Once a block was mined, meaning the algorithm meets network wide target and difficulty target, a block is said to be mined and proof    of work was found.
   # Reward
   An amount of bitcoin rewarded by the network to miner who found a proof of work solution every time a block is mined.
   # Secret key(private key)
    The secret number unlocking bitcoins sent to the corresponding address. A transaction is a signed data structure expressing a          transfer of value. Transactions are transmitted over the bitcoin network, collected by miners and included into blocks, made            permanent on the blockchain.
   # Transactions
    Transactions occur when a user transfer bitcoins from one address to another.
   # Wallet
    # Soft
     A software that holds your addresses. Use it to send bitcoin manage the keys. One well known wallet will be Exodus.
    # Hard
    It is a hardware, physically present which stores  Bitcoin, Ethereum and Altcoins. One well known one is Ledger Nano S.

## Ethereum Address
For ethereum, the address is as follows 0xCf3EA8b2b16E3BF2edd1EAB08D0104D0d9862970 and it was noted that the address starts with a 0 value.
